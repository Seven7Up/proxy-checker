# Python Binaries

## About:

Executable binaries builded using [`pyinstaller`](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/).

## Troubleshooting:

If you found any error with Linux binary, you just need in the MOST cases to check required libraries with `ldd` command

```bash
ldd ./main
```

and search the web if you don't have someone.
